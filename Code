# Instrument: Guitar 808 Bass (TunePad built-in)
# A supportive bass groove that complements the piano melody.
# Short notes + rests create syncopation and forward motion.

# Simple repeating bass loop reinforcing the groove and

# 8) Final Drum Layer
#    Instrument: 808 Drum Kit (TunePad built-in)
# Reinforces the ending groove alongside the synth pattern, keeping forward momentum and a strong rhythmic closure.
# (Percussive accents here use higher note numbers as mapped in this project’s kit.)
